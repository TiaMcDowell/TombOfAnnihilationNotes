## Post Pirate Fight
We fought the pirates before some Sahaugin attacked them. We left before they attacked us.

[[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] goes to absorb the soul of a dead pirate. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] protests briefly as extra spells for Valindra means extra spell slots for dumb Valindra. She absorbs it anyways.

[[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]] asks [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] about the morality of absorbing the souls. Locke can't remember what just happened, [[Morgan]]'s name, or even the quest to [[Wyrmheart Mine]]. [[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]], [[Sylvos]], and [[Musharib]] all try to touch him, but they're all pushed back. Sylvos even takes a bunch of psychic damage.

[[Locke Hancock|Locke]] runs away into his cabin, and the rest of the crew discuss Locke and his memory loss events.
## The Evening
The fog dissipates and the sun begins to set. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] actually says thank you to [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] and says she thinks he's a better person than she is. She's going to start rationing her Mind Blank spells to be used to meet [[Artus Cimber||her father]] and to fight [[Ozymandius]].

[[Brysh]] lies and claims that [[Locke Hancock|Locke]]'s new hat is cursed. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] sees through it and proves to himself and [[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]] it isn't.

## Valindra's Mind Ain't Blank
*Today will be a peaceful voyage at sea - Valindra*

[[Locke Hancock|Locke]] convinces her not to cast Mind Blank, and [[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]] takes her to play games.

[[Sylvos]] notices a strange island with a single palm tree. It seems to be moving towards us. It turns out to be a giant fuckoff crab! It's a harrowing fight, but we take it out with minor damage to the ship.
- Small holes that could use a patch job
- Some structural issues that will be an issue for handling the ship

We sail onwards for the rest of the day. The ship veers to the left slightly, but it's not a problem. Soon we drop anchor and arrive at [[Wyrmheart Mine]].

Tomorrow we'll be rescuing [[Artus Cimber]], saving the mine, and get a ton of adamantine.
