## Prelude with [[Morgan]]
He is summoned by [[Ras Nsi]] and visits a mysterious [[Yuan-ti]] sanctuary. Inside is [[Ras Nsi]] in seemingly his true form. A sickened and damaged snake body. He seems to be suffering from [[The Death Curse]].

[[Ras Nsi]] has mislead the [[Yuan-ti]] into believing he's a Yuan-ti god. He also presents [[Morgan]] a puzzle cube! However he mentions that our search for those cubes will be problematic. He's made a deal to protect the people of Mezro and himself. The [[Soul Mongerer]] is within the [[Tomb of the Dead Gods]] and the cubes are the key to getting it. He's made a pact with [[Acererak]] where [[Acererak]] would create an dimensional space to protect the people of [[The Lost City of Mezero|Mezero]] and keep them safe.

The [[Soul Mongerer]] cannot be destroyed without destroying [[The Lost City of Mezero]]. [[The Lost City of Mezero|Mezero]] is floating in [[Ravenloft]] and would be left floating in time and space. Forever disconnected from the material plane.

Perhaps the city could be returned by the sacrifice of an [[Abara]], but [[Ras Nsi]] is not willing to sacrifice himself for that. He's worried that [[Artus Cimber|Artus]] will do something brash to save his wife, and wants [[Morgan]] on his side to talk him down.

## We're no Longer Fucked
[[Morgan]] arrives and saves our asses. We get the cube of [[Shagambi]] and head back to camp.

Back at camp, [[Morgan]] offers to bring us to the [[Yuan-ti]] sanctuary for a safe night's sleep. He tells [[Artus Cimber|Artus]] about [[Ras Nsi]] being his patron. [[Artus Cimber|Artus]] is open to working with [[Ras Nsi]] in order to return [[The Lost City of Mezero|Mezero]], but [[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]] seems to doubt [[Artus Cimber|Artus]]'s intentions.

[[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] reveals that [[Artus Cimber|Artus]]'s plan is to kill [[Ras Nsi]]. He thinks the blood of a [[Abara]] with the [[Daijobi Senga]] would be enough to return [[The Lost City of Mezero|Mezero]].

When Artus was in Icewind Dale, he got a vision from [[Savras]] of his wife and family reuniting. He got control of the [[Ring of Winter]] and made his way back down south. He and [[Morgan]] argue a bit about [[Ras Nsi]]'s intentions.

[[Brysh]] mysteriously sets up an empty tent.

## The Night time
[[Locke Hancock|Locke]] has nightmares about losing control and fails an intelligence save. He thinks about how easy it would be to snap [[Orvex Ocrammas]] like a twig, but resists. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] does gain the ability to cast Pulse Wave innately.

[[Morgan]] and [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] cuddle.

[[Sylvos]] dreams about the ship crash and has an awful nightmare. He does not get a long rest, and out of character it's implied that it's [[Brysh]]'s fault. The empty tent is in case his nightmares get too bad for the others. It seems that the potion [[Brysh]] gave him in combat was a hag potion! He does not get a long rest and suffers from the effects of Bane.

## The Morning
We have 5/9 puzzle cubes, so we're half way done!

[[Morgan]] informs the party that [[Acererak|A]] is [[Acererak]]. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] describes him as an arch-lich who eclipses the powers of the mortal mind.

We visit the amphitheatre and find *The King of Feathers*, a giant dinosaur who teleports and spits bees.

We defeat the kickass dino and find some treasure (TBD) in the amphitheatre.
