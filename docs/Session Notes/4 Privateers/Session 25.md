"Letting people die is bad" - [[Locke Hancock]]
## Returning to the Heart
We debate teleporting back to the [[Heart of Ubtao]]. Apparently [[Ozymandius]] is getting an airship to head to [[Omu]].

We got a fuck ton of spell scrolls, and a handful of other magic items. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] finally accepts his Astral Translocator.

[[Sylvos]] also took the dossiers on each of us.

[[Morgan]] channels nearly all her life force into the phylactery, and gives [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] 26 soul points back.
## The Morning After
[[Locke Hancock|Locke]] almost forgot to grab [[Hew Hackinstone|Hew]] and [[Musharib]]!

[[Sylvos]] is a bad person. His parents profited from Apartheid in Silvery Moon.

[[Locke Hancock|Locke]] runs into the Captain's cabin, but [[Brysh]] tries to get their first. He skips past her shadow creature, and gets their first. It's beautiful, and he finds a perfect replacement for his tattered, cheap, tricorn hat. [[Brysh]] arrives right as he puts it on, and casts Friends on [[Locke Hancock|Locke]]. He's talked into leaving, and then realizes he's been tricked. He sadly walks to the lower decks, and [[Brysh]] sheepishly says sorry.
## Sailing the Six Seas
[[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]] comes to comfort [[Locke Hancock|Locke]], and he tries to teach her graph theory. It doesn't quite catch, but she does teach him dragon chess.

[[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] casts a Mind Blank on herself, and then proceeds to get sea sick (the astral flutters).

We're accosted by [[Aremag]] for gold. [[Brysh]] throws him more and more gold. After 35gp, he's finally satisfied.

[[Sylvos]] is the navigator, and mentions that one of the Mistcliff Mountains is moving. It's actually just a pirate ship coming in for an attack! As they run away, [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] assumes they're letting them leave, but [[Brysh]] turns the ship to follow themâ€¦
