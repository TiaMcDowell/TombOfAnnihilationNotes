We meet back up with the Cimbers.
- [[Morgan]] got the cube of [[Papazotl]] from [[Ras Nsi]]
- [[Morgan]] got the cube of [[Wongo]] after saving us
- [[Brysh]] has the [[Shagambi]] and [[Kubazan]] cubes from previous tombs.
- [[Artus Cimber|Artus]] retrieved the cube of [[I'jin]] and gave it to [[Brysh]]
- [[Ras Nsi]] is guarding one more

We head towards a flooded shrine and annihilate some red wizards outside. [[Imbok]] helps us communicate with the Gruung. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] kills the apprentice wizards as they run. [[Yorb]] their golden leader tries to communicate, and [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] does an impressive smoke dance. We got our 6th cube!

At the [[Unkh]] shrine, we see lots of evidence of [[The Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]] getting in. It also seems like they got the [[Moa]] shrine. [[Ras Nsi]] must have the [[Obo'laka]] cube.

[[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] get smarted again, and comments that she's no longer attuned to her robes and doesn't have meteor swarm prepared anymore. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] asks for a list of "chores" for next time. We then head on in to [[Ras Nsi]]'s lair.

[[Locke Hancock|Locke]] flirts a fair bit with a snake lady [[Fenthaza]]. [[Ras Nsi]] demands [[Morgan]]'s full allegiance, and he keeps using wordplay to try and get out of it. After a lot of negotiation of [[Ras Nsi]] is proposing we sacrifice [[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]], but the rest of the group thinks sacrificing [[Ras Nsi]] makes the most sense.
