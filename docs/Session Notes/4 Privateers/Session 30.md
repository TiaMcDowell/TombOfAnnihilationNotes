[[Brysh]] tells [[Orvex Ocrammas]] that [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] has memory issues. Then we head for the [[Kubazan]] shrine. This is where we got our mysterious gift from [[Acererak|A]].

We defeat a Froghemoth outside the shrine, and successfully snag a frog puzzle cube using a merchant's scale, two mage hands, and a translator.![[kubazan_colour.webp]]

The Cimbers successfully got their puzzle cube. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] made a few mistakes along the way, but it went mostly smoothly. They go to setup our camp and we head to another shrine.

The [[Shagambi]] shrine has several statues and a deep pit. There's stairs heading to the lower level. We get fucking stomped on my some clay statues. Everyone is going down. If only [[Morgan]] was here he could have saved us.
