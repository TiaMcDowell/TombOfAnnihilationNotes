# The Mine
We start at the beach outside [[Wyrmheart Mine]]. [[Brysh]] gives the magic eye of frog talking to [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]]. After some forest walking we arrive at the mine.

Inside the entrance is a shabby minecart. After briefly fixing the breaks and getting [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] mind blanked, we ride the minecart inside. Like a blur we fly by the traps and the kobolds.

[[Artus Cimber]] is wearing a pink dress and trying to escape some manacles. He has a southern accent!

The dragon attacks! We ride minecarts deep into the forge. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] hides in his portable hole in a third minecart, but right at the end it flips over. He falls out of the hole, teleports twice, and narrowly lands on the rails. Sadly the cart then falls on top of him, and he is knocked unconscious. [[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]] feather falls then vortex warps and saves him. [[Artus Cimber]] heals him a second time. [[Musharib]] thinks it's the coolest shit in the world.

# What Happened to Artus
He was searching for [[The Heart of the Wild]] in [[Tamalka Village]]. He found it, but Timber found him too. He tried to smooth talk his way, and accidentally seduced the dragon. He was planning to escape when the party came along.

# The Hoard
We return, and all the kobolds are either dead or running off.
