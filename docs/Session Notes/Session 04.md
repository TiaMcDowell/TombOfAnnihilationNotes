	- In front of the camp stands the statue of crocodile and man. See [[Explore the Statue of Man and Crocodile]].
	- [[Kir Sabel]], where [[Aarakocra]] are from, Cotton is friendly there.
	- The legend of ___ spirit of the jungle, represent the will of the jungle, sees through the jungle. Killing animals without prayers of respect will anger it. Man and crocodile is a statue of the creature.
	- The statue also references a story from the jungle:
			- Once there was a crocodile who helped a man cross the river in exchange for doing the same to the crocodile.
			- Once acrossed, the crocodile asked the man to carry it across all the land.
			- The man did not, and so they are not friends.
