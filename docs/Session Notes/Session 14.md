The mech and [[Rodvan]] come down the river. They want to sleep in [[Camp Vengeance]] in exchange for helping defend the camp with the [[Clockwork Golem]].

His apprentice Ellias took first watch while Rodvan came inside to sleep. Before sleeping, lots of conversation happened.

[[Ash]] brought up the Doom Vault. The headquarters of magical research in Thay. Doubles as a vault for magical secrets. It's beneath Thay Mount, the captial of Thay.

[[Locke Hancock]] and [[Xandala Cimber]] chatted with Rodvan, while the rest of the party schemed to kill [[The Red Wizards of Thay]] and steal the golem.

The party decides to head out to the [[Heart of Ubtao]] to make a deal with [[Shadow Mantle]].

We level up to 5th level and get a long rest!
