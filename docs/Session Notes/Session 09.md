# Session 09
Party starts walking down a path in the forest.
Learned about the "shivering sickness" caused by the insects of Chult.

[[Ash]] deducted the ingredients of the insect repellent

[[Ash]] and [[Yosei]] hear a broken branch during their watch. They see a small creature hiding in a tree. It turns out to be the first of a pack of velociraptors that attack the party. 

[[Locke Hancock]] had a flashback and ran from battle.

[[Brysh]] runs into a stray cobblestone on the path along the way the party is going, [[Locke Hancock]] investigates. The party finds more and more as they walk down the path, making an old paved road.

The party finds themselves in [[The Maze]], [[Brysh]] detects necromancy, also senses that this is not the original purpose of the maze.

In the maze we find images of eyes carved into the walls every 20ft, the vines do lots of damage when harmed

We find a plate with the image of [[Ubtao]] inside the maze. We get the vibe it is designed to be collected. [[Brysh]] notices necromancy inside the walls.

We find a stone baboon head on the Maze wall with a blue quartz in it, it detects as abjuration. We took the orb and an [[Beholder Zombie]] arrived, the orb seemed to make the beholder unable to use one of the eyes. We fought and the beholder escaped.

Upon travelling the maze further, we find another baboon head with a clear quartz in it, and another pedestal with a T-Rex image engraved in it. We take this on as well. The gem is mundane.

We find a third green orb, this one is arcane. There does not seem to be a pedestal for the green gem. The beholder reappeared after pulling this gem.
