Arriving in [[Camp Righteous]], the party encountered new allies. Stranded by [[Aremag]] and taking canoes down river, they were seperated from [[Artus Cimber]] and only arrived right before [[Locke Hancock]], [[Brysh]], [[Xandala Cimber]] and folks arrived.

[[Xandala Cimber]] had a bit of a heart to heart with the friends of her father in this new party.
They previously met [[Artus Cimber]] and traveled with him to Chult before being separated, [[Artus Cimber]] is a member of [[The Harpers]] along with [[Yosei]] and [[Sylvos]]. All parties agree to travel together to try and find [[Artus Cimber]]

Cousins [[Yosei]] and [[Sylvos]] were taught some "archeologist" adventurer techniques by throwing ball bearings at an outhouse. [[Yosei]] lost one in the grass, but he also found a dead body in the outhoust with a holy symbol of Mystra. It's about 5 days old.

The party decides to check out the statue of man and crocodile in [[Camp Righteous]] from [[Explore the Statue of Man and Crocodile]]. Because the [[Aarakocra]] mentioned that they believed that the spirit depicted there was responsible for harming [[The Flaming Fist]]

At the center of the camp was a large status of [[Man and Crocodile]]. [[Brysh]] casts detect magic and senses Divination → divination/conjuration → Evocation in the hallway showing several traps:
- The first 10ft is a 20ft deep pit that will activate when it detects life, the party threw a fish on it to activate it and then climb on the 6in ledge on either side
- The Next 10ft magic blades will appear when a passing creature is not on top of another creature.
- Up a 7ft wall there's a 4x4 grid of squares. You must look at the door at the end of the hallway to find the correct path through the 4x4 grid. Stepping on the wrong squares causes fire to spew out.
- Up another 7ft wall was a door with a glyph of warding that cast thunder wave when triggered. When two people pushed the four glowing squares, the door opened.
- Inside the door was a room with a circular starecase. They used detect magic sensed that steps 3, 10, 17, 23 on the pillar had abjuration magic and were glyphs of warding, but we marked them with chalk. Atop was a statue of a woman who wore a magical item: a veil of shadows. [[Locke Hancock]] grabbed the veil, but that caused rocks to fall in the room and forced the party to escape the temple.

Eventually, the party escaped, but at heavy cost. Nearly everyone was hurt, loads of spell slots were used, and four party members fell unconcious.

[[Locke Hancock]] gave the veil to [[Brysh]] to identify

## Next Session
- Learn more about veil (maybe follow a lead from there)
- Make way to [[Camp Vengeance]]
- (maybe) Look for clockwork golem
