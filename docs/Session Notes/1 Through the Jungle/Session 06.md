Party takes a short rest in [[Camp Righteous]]

- Party identifies [[Veil of Uluu Thalongh]]
- The party decides to [[Recover the Clockwork Golem]]
- They travel into the forest and find a clearing with:
	- The red wizard dead and covered in honey
		- It seems [[Goblins]] used the honey to attract insects which ate him alive.
		- He was a member of [[The Red Wizards of Thay]].
	- A wand that was used to write "Save me [[Valindra Cimber]]"
	- A bronze statue([[Clockwork Golem]])
		- The [[Clockwork Golem]] can be controlled by someone on the inside.
		- It contains various CRT screens, buttons, nobs, and other electronic gismos.
- While tinkering with the golem, [[Brysh]] continually used telepathy on [[Locke Hancock]] despite him demanding she stop. Finally he snapped, left the golem, and yelled at Brysh.
- Lured by Locke's yelling, [[Goblins]] attacked the party
	- The [[Goblins]] say something about "Holy Idol" and "defend", which implies the golem is a religeous artifact of theirs.
- [[Morgan]] took a [[Goblins]] heart to eat later.
- [[Locke Hancock]] shares his background with [[Yosei]]
- All the tents in [[Camp Righteous]] are empty. It seems [[The Flaming Fist]] deliberately moved out, but left the tents.
- Around the campfire, members of the party chatted about their various goals and motives for visiting Chult.
- Before heading to bed, the group decided to name themselves *The Fellowship of the Veil*.
- [[Xandala Cimber]] then shared her letter from [[Artus Cimber]] with the entire group and discussed the [[Ring of Winter]].
