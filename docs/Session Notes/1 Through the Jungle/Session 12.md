After nearly escaping, [[Locke Hancock]] realizes the mummy armor might be his only shot at good armor for a while. With the King Mbalawa injured, he rushes back in with the rest of the party following.

Upon searching the corpse, two magic items are found. A smoking suite of armor, and a magical staff. Locke puts on the armor, and doesn't notice any immediate curses.

Before resting for the night, the party debates where to go.

[[Brysh]] finishes identifying the [[Ring of Ubtao]], but fails to identifying if there's curses.
Locke identifies his armor while wearing it. It's Smoldering Chain Mail, and he can use it to cast Misty Step once per dawn!
[[Morgan]] identifies the staff as a Rain Stick!

The team decides to go back to [[Camp Vengeance]] before [[Seek the Wisdom of the Oracle]]. They want to ask:
- Where in Chult can we find [[Artus Cimber]].
- How will Locke return to the Astral Sea and unite with his love Betsy?
- Ask about [[The Death Curse]].
- Ask about the [[Soul Mongerer]].
