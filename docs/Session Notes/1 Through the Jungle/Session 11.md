Past where Locke explored last time in [[The Maze]], the party found another plate with an island like carving.

Morgan then tried the plates. Maze at 12 oclock, Peninsula at 3, T-Rex at 6, and then Walled City at 9.
It opens up an under ground passage with a small square box containing the [[Ring of Ubtao]].
- The party argued about what to do with it
- [[Morgan]] kept it for now, and agreed to look at the ring with [[Brysh]]

The party left the plates in the maze and ventured to [[Mbala]]. There they met [[Nanny Pu'pu]], and [[Brysh]] traded some gems and gold for potions and other magic item.

[[Morgan]] continues his pessimism as they explore the statue in Mbala. Inside the tomb, [[Locke Hancock]] and [[Yosei]] open the sarcophogus and find the mummy who lives!
