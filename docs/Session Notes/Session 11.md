We go through an untraveled path, and find the last disc.

[[Morgan]] inserts the discs starting at 12 o'clock [[Ubtao]] disc, Chult at 3 o'clock, Dino at 6 o'clock, city 9 o'clock.

The side on the obelisk descends, revealing, a box with a gold ring with a purple gem in it.

The discs give off divination, the necromancy fading. Abjuration/ divination on the ring. 

We find the Gate, however the magic is gone, and it is open.

The maze may have acted as a gatehouse for the town of [[Mbala]]

[[Ring of Obtao]]:
This bejeweled ring is engraved with a tiny, intricate maze. While worn, you gain a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws. This ring also gives you advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate, and advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks to interact with dinosaurs.

We arrive at [[Mbala]]. 

We see the hideout of the [[The Red Wizards of Thay]] and the zuggarate for the [[Seek the Wisdom of the Oracle]] quest.

We find a statue with cupped hands with a plaque that reads:

Whose mother is a cloud,  
Whose father is the sky,  
Whose child is a band of colors,  
Whose enemy is dry?

There is a crease in front of the statue, the hands have divination magic on them. The late king of [[Mbala]], Mbalawa. He is berried under the statue

As the water touches the hand, it slides back, revealing a staircase heading down.

[[Brysh]] and [[Morgan]] head down the stairs and see carvings of a prosperas land on top of a mesa. 

We see the witch doctor, she has human ribs as a necklace [[Nanny Pu'pu]]

Raising the dead requires the body of a living host and a gemstone to be embedded in their head. 

The death curse has been happening for a few weeks. 

Suspects the old coven created the death curse. The [[sewn sisters]], there are 3 of them. They are Hags. They wanted to reach out to bigger cosmic powers, and [[Nanny Pu'pu]] didn't want to, so she was excommunicated. She will reward us for killing them, extra if they suffered. 

[[Nanny Pu'pu]] offers 3 potions and 2 tickets.

[[Brysh]] buys all of them, for all 3 mundane gems + 15 GP.

We decend under the statue,

We find a scroll with a picture of a man with a staff with a rain cloud above him. 

The alcoves on the side with coffins in them, have inscription of "loyal servant", "right-hand man", etc.
