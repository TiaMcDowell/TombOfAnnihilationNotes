[[Ash]] wants to stop the power word pain on [[Ellias]], so she went to petition [[Valindra Cimber]].

## Visions of a Snake Man
[[Morgan]] had a weird purple nose bleed. Her vision got blurrier and blurrier, so [[Sylvos]] snapped at her to get her attention. Morgan found herself in a marbel floor room with a grandfather clock inside. There's double doors with a gilded gold frame, and an orante writing desk, and large windows viewing the Jungle from above. Gazing outside, the room seems to be moving through the air!

The room seems to be on the shell of a skeleton turtle. Morgan looks for landmarks she recognizes, but can't seem to orient herself. She pushes through the door, and sees a creature. Top half man, but the bottom half is a snake like creature. Slicked black hair, sword at hip, purple tatoos, and a familiar presence.

The lower half of his body in a flash transforms and he appears as a human in a suit and dress shirt. He sensed Morgan wished to discuss something, and wants to talk to Morgan about it.

> The party notes out of character that [[Locke Hancock]] has an anus.

His name is [[Ras Nsi]], and he is an exiled [[Abara]] from Mezro. Morgan informs him about the [[Soul Mongerer]] and that he's concerned about [[The Red Wizards of Thay]] searching for it. She believes the ex coven of [[Nanny Pu'pu]] created it.

Ras Nsi recommends speaking to see the oracle, and there's an array of traps. You need to be as fast as possible, and there's an "implement" to ensure you stay moving. However [[The Death Curse]] is still her top priority, and it may have caused Ras Nsi to lose control of the undead.

Morgan asks about [[Artus Cimber]], and Ras Nsi knows about him.

> "I have good history with Artus. We saved the city together."

Artus may not like Ras Nsi, but he has no ill feelings towards him. The children of Bara tend to have intersting destinies and powers.

Ras Nsi explains that this place is a vision: a manufactured relality from a memory of his. He returns Morgan to the waking world.

That whole conversation only took about a moment in real life. Morgan says that Artus Cimber would have gone to Mezro.

## Preparing to Leave the [[Heart of Ubtao]]
Ash talks to Valindra about healing Elias. She accepts, but he needs to resign from the Red Wizards and give a written appology.

Elias passes out immediately after being helped.

[[Locke Hancock]] tries to convince Elias to no longer be racist, but Ash casts Tiny Hut to chat more privately with Elias. Ash convinces Elias to play ball, and he agrees to resign.

> "It's degrading to other people, who may feel power word pained when you say it." - Ash

[[Rodvan]] agrees to take Elias back to Thay, and Locke says his goodbyes.

Valindra sees concerned about Locke's loyalty. [[Brysh]] insists that he's leaving once they return to [[Camp Vengeance]] and will no longer be a problem.

[[Xandala Cimber]] gives Valindra an awkward hug goodbye. Xandala gets uncomfrotable and shuffles away.

Shadowmantle casts Feather Fall on the party as they fall down to the ground.

## Returning to the Jungle
Brysh ends up manning the [[Clockwork Golem]] and learns how to run the thing!

The party decides to head straight to the oracle to complete [[Seek the Wisdom of the Oracle]].

After a day without random encounters, Brysh attunes to the [[Veil of Uluu Thalongh]] overnight in preparation for the secret talk.

Ash and Sylvos are on a friendship break. It's an awkward watch.

Right before sunrise, Brysh uses the veil and sees no one spying.

We discussed passphrases to convey that Valindra is watching
- "Conversation beyond the veil": Use the veil to talk secretly
- "The weather isn't good tonight": Valindra is watching
