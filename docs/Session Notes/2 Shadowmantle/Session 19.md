The party finds out Locke will never see Betsy again.
He will never have a successful career as a researcher.
Rodvan actually didn't like him and was just pumping him for information.
He had some trauma in his backstory, but no one cares.
Eberron was a pretty shitty setting anyways.

[[Valindra Cimber]] sends a message to [[Ash]] looking for an update. She tells her that they're about 4 hours away.

Since the party is so close, [[Brysh]] doesn't want to use a 3rd level spell slot on the mech. The party debates the spell slot efficiency of different people powering the [[Clockwork Golem]]. Ultimately it's decided that Brysh will just use her 3rd level slot for it.

As part of the first puzzle of [[Orolunga]], Locke jumps 16ft, which is slightly more than Ash could.

"What is the location of the soul mongerer?"
> The soloumonger lays entombed beneath the forbidden city of omu. 90 miles south, 30 miles east, 100ft beneath the surface.

"Where is Artus Cimber now?"
> [[Artus Cimber]] has been captured by a red dragon: 100 miles south, 25 miles west

"Where is the real lost city of Mezro"
> The real Mezro has been plane shifted and ensnared in the mists of Ravenloft. It is being prepped to serve as a reservoir for the souls siphoned from the astral sea by the soul mongerer.

It seems that the Professor's Conjecture was correct! The party levels up to 6th level.
