The session starts in the skiff, and the party discusses their plans and what they know about [[Artus Cimber]].

Taylor tells the group (in character) about his patron "in relation to Artus Cimber"
- "Artus worked with my patron Ras Nsi to save [[The Lost City of Mezero]]"
- "That is how he met [[Alisandra Cimber]] and they hooked up"
- "Alisandra is abara of this land. They are one of the imortal guardians destined to protect Chult."
- "So based on the letter and Artus' beliefs, he's likely heading to Mezro to find the lost city and his wife. Ras Nsi believes he will find neither."
- His patron doesn't know about the soul mongerer.

About 40 years ago (in the 1450s) Artus defended Mezro from the [[Cult of the Frost]], about 15 years ago Netheril invaded Cormyr, and 10 years ago Mezro fell during the second sundering cataclysm.

[[Locke Hancock]] presents "The Professor's Conjecture" that the city of Mezro is no longer [[The Lost City of Mezero]]. He preposed that the real city is hidden elsewhere. Since the city was protected and secretive, this would mean no outside would be able to tell if the ruins were actually the ruins of Mezro. It also explains why looters haven't found anything.

Instead of asking about Betsy, the party will use that question to ask about the professor's conjecture.

After a day of travel and a fight with a [[Kamadan]], [[Brysh]] takes out a "pet" from her urn. She reveals a shadow spirit!
