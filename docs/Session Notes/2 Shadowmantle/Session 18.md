The session starts in the skiff, and the party discusses their plans and what they know about [[Artus Cimber]].

Taylor tells the group (in character) about his patron "in relation to Artus Cimber"
- "Artus worked with my patron Ras Nsi to save [[The Lost City of Mezero]]"
- "That is how he met [[Alisandra Cimber]] and they hooked up"
- "Alisandra is abara of this land. They are one of the imortal guardians destined to protect Chult."
- "So based on the letter and Artus' beliefs, he's likely heading to Mezro to find the lost city and his wife. Ras Nsi believes he will find neither."
- His patron doesn't know about the soul mongerer.

About 40 years ago (in the 1450s) Artus defended Mezro from the [[Cult of the Frost]], about 15 years ago Netheril invaded Cormyr, and 10 years ago Mezro fell during the second sundering cataclysm.

[[Locke Hancock]] presents "The Professor's Conjecture" that the city of Mezro is no longer [[The Lost City of Mezero]]. He preposed that the real city is hidden elsewhere. Since the city was protected and secretive, this would mean no outside would be able to tell if the ruins were actually the ruins of Mezro. It also explains why looters haven't found anything.

Instead of asking about Betsy, the party will use that question to ask about the professor's conjecture.

After a day of travel and a fight with a [[Kamadan]], [[Brysh]] takes out a "pet" from her urn. She reveals a shadow spirit! It's a gift from her "best friend".

Brysh is cagy about who her best friend is, but [[Sylvos]] hears whispers from the urnâ€¦ If the urn breaks, it would release all her "pets" in the urn.

Before everyone goes to sleep, [[Xandala Cimber]] pulls the counsins [[Yosei]] and [[Sylvos]] aside to warn them of [[Ras Nsi]]. Apparently Ras Nsi is one of the original [[Abara]] and was exiled 2000-3000 years ago. Before Mezro there was a group of people called the Eshowe. They clashed with the people of Mezro, so Ras Nsi sent his undead army to wipe them out compleately. The Abara didn't condone this, so they exiled him. With no longer needing to fend off the Eshowe, the city of Mezro could develope and advance their technology much quicker. He still serves Mezro, but he's fanatical in his devotion to Mezro. Ras Nsi cannot enter the city, but fought the [[Cult of the Frost]] from afar.

Yosei and Sylvos still don't attune to their magic items. Ash, Morgan, and Brysh all still attune.

**The next morning, the party remembers that moss grows on the west side of trees!**

Upon nearly reaching the oracle, the party discovers a dead stegasaurus. It appears to have had mad-dinosaur disease. It was killed by something with a very long blade or claw.

Locke claims Sylvos and Yosei are centrist and their beliefs are "faliable" and ever changing. They almost attune to their magic items, but decide against it.

Next session the party goes to the oracle.
- Where in Chult can we find [[Artus Cimber]].
- Ask about [[The Death Curse]] / [[Soul Mongerer]].
- Ask about the Professor's Conjecture
