After some martial training and giving the rainstick to [[Brysh]], the party heads from [[Mbala]] to [[Camp Vengeance]].

While fighting some ghouls, we encountered a zombie girallon! It nearly killed [[Xandala Cimber]], but her staff glowed and created a strange magic rune underneath her until she woke up and grabbed it.

After a brief senior moment from [[Locke Hancock]] and looting of the area, the party returned to [[Camp Vengeance]]. [[Locke Hancock]] used his sensitivity training to break the news to [[Hew Hackinstone]] and [[Musharib]] that we have to turn back and take a ship to the dragon's den.

As Locke returned to the party, [[Yosei]] and [[Sylvos]] spotted the Red Wizard from before who Locke interrogated. He's paddling down the river, and has a clockwork mech in toe.
