# Session 05
- Party starts at level 3
- Met the other members of party
- [[Dylan's Character]], [[Sylvos]], and [[Ash]] previously met [[Artus Cimber]] and traveled with him to Chult before being separated, [[Artus Cimber]] is a member of [[The Harpers]] along with [[Dylan's Character]] and [[Sylvos]]
- They agree to travel together to try and find [[Artus Cimber]]
- The party decides to check out the statue of man and crocodile in [[Camp Righteous]] from [[Explore the Statue of Man and Crocodile]]. Because the [[Aarakocra]] mentioned that they believed that the spirit depicted there was responsible for harming [[The Flaming Fist]]
- [[Brysh]] casts detect magic and senses Divination → divination/conjuration → Evocation in the hallway 
- The party struggles for a long time, many almost dying, but at last they are able to find the answer to the hallway
	- The first 10ft is a pit that will activate when it detects life, the party threw a fish on it to activate it and then climb on the 6in ledge on either side 
	- The next 10ft will have arcane blades slash at you unless you have one person on your back
	- The next 10ft is a puzzle where you must look at the door at the end of the hallway to find the correct path through the 4x4 grid
	- The door had a glyph of warding on it that cast thunder wave when triggered, to disable this and open the door hold the 4 glowing squares
- The party gained entry to the chamber inside the statue and with detect magic sensed that steps 3, 10, 17, 23 on the pillar had abjuration magic. And there was a bust with a veil on it with divination and abjuration
- [[Locke Handcock]] climbed the pillar and grabbed the veil as the room started to collapse around him
- the Party escaped the room safely with the veil
- [[Locke Handcock]] gave the veil to [[Brysh]] to identify

# Next Session
- Learn more about veil (maybe follow a lead from there)
- Make way to [[Camp Vengeance]]
- (maybe) Look for clockwork golem
