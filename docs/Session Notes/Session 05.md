# Session 05

Arriving in [[Camp Righteous]], the party encountered new allies. Stranded by [[Aremag]] and taking canoes down river, they were seperated from [[Artus Cimber]] and only arrived right before [[Locke Handcock]], [[Brysh]], [[Xandala Cimber]] and folks arrived.

[[Xandala Cimber]] had a bit of a heart to heart with the friends of her father in this new party.

Cousins [[Yosei]] and [[Sylvos]] were taught some "archeologist" adventurer techniques by throwing ball bearings at an out house. [[Yosei]] lost one in the grass, but he also found a dead body in the outhoust with a holy symbol of Mystra. It's about 5 days old.

At the center of the camp was a large status of [[Man and Crocodile]]. Inside were several traps:
- A 20ft pit trap activated by a creature standing on it.
- Magic blades which appear when a creature is not carrying another creature.
- Up a 7ft wall there's a 4x4 grid of squares. Stepping on the wrong squares causes fire to spew out.
- Up another 7ft wall was a door with a glyph of warding. Two creatures must push on it to open it.
- Inside the door was a room with a circular starecase. Different stairs also had glyphs of warding on them, but we marked them with chalk. Atop was a statue of a woman who wore a magical item: a veil of shadows. [[Locke Handcock]] grabbed the veil, but that caused rocks to fall in the room and forced the party to escape the temple.

Eventually, the party escaped, but at heavy cost. Nearly everyone was hurt, loads of spell slots were used, and four party members fell unconcious.
