In the morning, everyone was shocked to see [[Brysh]] roughly two feet taller.

[[Locke Hancock]] compared Brysh's transformation to that of a bananafly.

While boating to the [[Heart of Ubtao]], the party was attacked by a group of plesiosaurus'. Brysh and [[Ellias]] got pulled under water, and Ellias nearly died before [[Locke Hancock]] saved him.

During the evening, Locke and [[Rodvan]] chat about magic, bouncing lightning bolts off walls, and war tactics. Locke reveals he enlisted in a war once, but doesn't wish to do it again.

Arriving at the [[Heart of Ubtao]], they meet [[Shadowmantle (aka Valindra Cimber)]] who looks an awful lot like Valindra. [[Xandala Cimber]] acknoledges this and says "sssSister?". Alexander called it last session when [[Rodvan]] was shocked to see [[Xandala Cimber]].
