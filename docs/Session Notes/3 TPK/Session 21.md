[[Locke Hancock]] is snoring loudly in his tent.

Heading back to [[Port Nyanzaru]], the party ties the canoes to the mech such that rowing is redundant.

We find a rotting Tyrannosaurus Rex with a dead adventurer in its mouth. It's actually undead and attacks!

The adventurer had a sickle-like sword. Similar to a short sword. There's also a strange chainmail cape. It's shockingly light and breathable. The adventurer bears a symbol of the Emerald Enclave

[[Morgan]] forages 5 pounds of insect repellant and food, but that's exactly how much we need for the day.

That evening, [[Brysh]] checks the sword for curses and [[Locke Hancock]] identifies the chainmail.
- The sword is likely not cursed
- The cloak is a cloak of protection!

[[Xandala Cimber]] asked [[Brysh]] for help with her picture frame.

The following day, we return to [[Port Nyanzaru]]. We paddle along the coast and see the cityscape on the horizon.

In the city, we bought bagels.
