We walk on up to the dinosaurs and see a number of them in the pen.

[[Locke Hancock]] picks a Triceratops
[[Brysh]] takes you Hadrosaurus
[[Morgan]] also picks Triceratops

1) Necklace of fireballs
2) Gem of brightness
3) Portable hole

# The Race
Locke gets an early lead with some lucky rolls. He throws a fog cloud, and Brysh drops a hex (knocking another competitor out of the race).

Morgan is able to skillfully control her dino and get a blessing from some priests.

Locke and Brysh fall out of their saddles after being hit by some water canons by gnome artificers.

Getting back in their saddles, they see some streamers ahead. Locke casts Gust of Wind and blows it away, but pushes his Triceratops too far. It's exhausted.

# Morgan's Vision
Right as she finishes the race, Morgan feels a trickle of blood and falls unconscious. She feels hot mist as she appears to be on a stone tile floor in a greenhouse.

[[Ras Nsi]] greets her and mentions that [[Morgan]] called her. Ras Nsi is surprised that she achieved lichdom in such short a period.

> "If it's a daughter of Artus, we can rule out ignorance." - Ras Nsi

With the [[Soul Mongerer]], he could make an attempt at undoing the lichdom, but there's no guarantee.

# Victory Ceremony
The party pulls Morgan's unconscious body to the side. Locke blames the teje. The three of us won the race and all three prizes.

Locke convinces Brysh to trade him the Portable Hole for the Gem of Brightness. She's quite reluctant, but he's worried about her accidentally putting it into her urn.

Morgan gives his fireball necklace to Brysh and has her buy him his Triceratops [[Stomp Stomp]].
> "Brysh pay the man" - Morgan

# Partying with the Lizard Wizards
We return to [[The Thundering Lizard]] and greet  [[The Red Wizards of Thay]]. Many of the patrons are head shaven and red robed.

[[Rodvan]] and [[Locke Hancock]] reunite! Rodvan calls him the man of the hour and buys him a drink (but it's an open bar).

[[Ozymandius]] says that Szassy Ti ([[Szass Tam]]) was getting impatient, and he was almost about to oust [[Valindra Cimber]]. Locke apologies for that...

A man in a grey suit is looking at us from above and smoking a cigarette. [[Brysh]] goes to speak with him. He claims to drink and load cargo in the docs.

[[Brysh]], [[Xandala Cimber]], [[Locke Hancock]], and [[Ozymandius]] play beer pong as [[Rodvan]] tries to strike a conversation with [[Morgan]]. She shuts him down hard.
