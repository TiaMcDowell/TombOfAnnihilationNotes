## Shopping and Trading
The party buys and sells a bunch in the market.

It looks like someone broke into the [[Temple of Savras]]! Two strangers roughed up the priest [[Grandfather Zitembe]]. It seems the thugs were [[Zhentarim]] and were looking for [[Artus Cimber]].

After speaking with [[Grandfather Zitembe]], we visit [[Prince Wakanga O'Tamu]].
> "You can bring \[a mech\] in here. It'll destroy the carpet!"
> "Then move the carpet!" - [[Morgan]]

[[Prince Wakanga O'Tamu]] is very excited about the mech. [[Brysh]] shows off how it's powered by spells. [[Locke Hancock]] mentions he's from space, and Wakanga doesn't believe him. He thinks Locke is a bard...

[[Prince Wakanga O'Tamu]] paid 750gp for his ship, and he would pay 100gp for the veil.

Apparently [[Ozymandius]] just got back from Mezro, and is going to party at [[The Thundering Lizard]].

We trade the mech for 30gp, a Rod of the Pact Keeper, and an Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Divination.

[[Brysh]] very quickly names the borrowed ship Going Merry.

During a short rest, [[Brysh]] examines [[Xandala Cimber]]'s photo. Strangely it is an incredibly powerful magic item. It seems to radiate memories and history, and is full of time magic.

## Lore Dump
Green lights dance in our vision. We all have a strange out of body experience. From the perspective of [[Valindra Cimber]], we see [[Xandala Cimber]] cause a small explosion outside as Xandala falls in the mud. Valindra sees her as the family favorite, and resents her.

Late at night, Valindra climbs back in her window, but drops a bag full of stolen magic books from the restricted section. Her parents are shouting.

Next day she wakes up around 2pm. The house is strangely quiet. [[Xandala Cimber]] is standing right outside her bedroom. Something is wrong with [[Artus Cimber]]. [[Alisandra Cimber]] had to return to Mezro. Valindra isolates herself and falls into her studying. Artus drinks heavily, and several days later the house is full of cold ice. Artus seems to have taken the [[Ring of Winter]] and transformed.

Valindra is just stuck taking care of Xandala, and feels it was inevitable this happened to Artus and Alisandra. However no matter how much she hates Xandala, she won't leave her behind. The money will run out eventually, and Valindra knows it.

A war wizard knocks on the door. Valindra was enlisted [[Cormyr]] to fight Xandala at the young age of 16.

In the trenches, Valindra vomits into the mud. She gets into the line, and prepares to try and take the next trench. Fireballs roar overhead, and Valindra hastes forward. She sprints through the trenches and begins combat with a Prince of Shade. She knows she's meant to sacrifice herself here, but instead saves herself to get back to Xandala.

## [[Port Nyanzaru]] Part Two
This isn't just any magic item. It contains a soul. It's [[Valindra Cimber]]'s phylactery. It can only be destroyed via 10 or more cold damage in a single turn. Everyone sees the memories, but only [[Brysh]] learns of it's true power. However she doesn't tell the others about Valindra's soul.

"Un-lich this bitch" - Tia

[[Brysh]] tells [[Locke Hancock]] about the phylactery.

[[Xandala Cimber]] agrees that if Valindra will kill someone, she will be okay with destroying her.

Next session we'll start with the dinosaur race!
