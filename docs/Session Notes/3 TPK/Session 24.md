Kyne is back!
## The Handsome Ranger
There's agents of [[The Harpers]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]].

Harper agent "[[Soggy Wren]]" is using the cover of a drunken businessmen working at the docs. [[Sylvos]] chats with him. [[Soggy Wren]] met [[Artus Cimber]] and had a drink with him.

[[Soggy Wren]] says that [[Artus Cimber]] was going to [[Tamalka Village]], which is [[Morgan]]'s home town!

### Red Wizard Fun Facts
The [[The Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]] are in the tavern right now. There's a high level abjurer who is chatting with Shadowmantle upstairs. Similar skill level to [[Rodvan]].

[[Valindra Cimber]] was likely turned into a lich in preparation to become a [[Zulkir]]. Lichdom had some detrimental side effects. She holds them back with a mind blank spell. However it comes from a mage dueling society in Thay.

[[Ozymandius]] hates [[Valindra Cimber]] and vice versa.

[[Szass Tam]]'s full time plot is thwarting murder plots within his own ranks.

> "A Thayan handshake is stab in the back"

[[Sylvos]] then returns to the party and sees them playing beer pong.

## Beer Pong and Sea Shanties
[[Sylvos]] asks [[Morgan]] about [[Tamalka Village]]. He gives almost no information.

[[Xandala Cimber]] goes to buy another drink, and [[Brysh]] sees [[Sylvos]] for the first time in a while. She's quite sassy.

[[Brysh]] is summoned to chat with [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] while [[Locke Hancock|The Professor]] teaches everyone in the bar space sea-shanties. They're a huge hit.

## Brysh and the Lich Bitch
[[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] asks how much credit is owed to [[Brysh]] for the great success. She says about a 5th. She then asks how many of the PCs are attuned to their magic items, and it's awkward to answer. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] wants [[Brysh]] to come with her to get the [[Soul Mongerer]]. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] offers "a carrot" (20 platinum), and asks that Brysh stays in her seat during what comes next.

Then the abjurer [[Sylora]] comes to fetch everyone else. [[Ozymandius]], [[Rodvan]], [[Sylvos]], [[Locke Hancock|Locke]], and [[Morgan]] arrive.

[[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] interrogates [[Locke Hancock|Locke]], [[Sylvos]], and [[Morgan]] about their loyalties. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] asks [[Brysh]] who she cares more about: [[Sylvos]] or [[Locke Hancock|The Professor]]. She immediately picks [[Locke Hancock|Locke]]. He is told to wait in the SE corner.

[[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] sends "If you think I'm going soft, scry me" to someone (likely [[Szass Tam]]). She prepares to kill [[Locke Hancock|Locke]], but can't do it. [[Xandala Cimber]] cries and runs to her sister. [[Ozymandius]] smiles in the background. The lights go dark, and [[Szass Tam]] appears. "That is enough". [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] drops her wand, and stumbles backward. She stumbles backward, as her appears changes.

[[Morgan]] runs towards [[Ozymandius]], and [[Sylvos]] checks [[Xandala Cimber|Xandala]]'s backpack.

"I was fired. This can't be happening." [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] begins to ugly cry on the floor. [[Ozymandius]] wants to kill her, and [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] tries to negotiate for her safety. It seems like [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] has been cut off from the Doom Vault's souls, and [[Ozymandius|Ozzy]] is now in charge. He proceeds to try and execute her, but [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] and the rest of the party try save [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]].

When [[Ozymandius]] realizes the party is willing to fight, he takes [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]]'s satchel, the rest of the [[The Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]], and leaves. [[Rodvan]] and [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] have one last goodbye. [[Locke Hancock|Locke]] tells him to find him if he changes his mind.

[[Morgan]] gives [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] the amulet of non-detection, and gets her to attune to it as soon as she can. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] is wallowing in self pity and feels that the potential to see her father again is a poor consolation prize.

[[Sylvos]] asks about the mind blank rumors. [[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] explains that she was selected for "advanced" lichdom due to her lineage. There were some incompatibilities, and her mind way frayed. With a mind blank spell, she can stave it off each day.

[[Valindra Cimber|Valindra]] only has 212 soul charges left, since Tia rolled really bad on 1d300 + 200.

We all level up to 7th level!
