- Party starts at level 3
- [[Brysh]] gives [[Xandala Cimber]] a loan of 11sp for adventure gear.
- Met a young stegosaurus and Cotton talked to him and got him to leave and not tell his mom where we are.
- We smelt some honey and dead things, which indicates goblin territory.
- Some flying [[Aarakocra]] met us while canoing down river.
	- They hate clear-cutting by [[The Flaming Fist]].
	- The think The Flaming Fist deserve their destruction by the jungle
	- Apparently [[Camp Righteous]] is destroyed.
	- In front of the camp stands the statue of crocodile and man. See [[Explore the Statue of Man and Crocodile]].
	- [[Kir Sabel]], where [[Aarakocra]] are from, Cotton is friendly there.
	- The legend of ___ spirit of the jungle, represent the will of the jungle, sees through the jungle. Killing animals without prayers of respect will anger it. Man and crocodile is a statue of the creature.
	- The statue also references a story from the jungle:
		In the early days of the world, Man stood by the banks of a river, frightened. Crocodile raised his head from the water and asked, "What troubles you, cousin Man?"
		Man said, "I must cross this river, but I fear to enter the water alone, because it teems with your brethren."
		Crocodile replied, "It's true, you would not be safe. But I will carry you across the river safely on my back, if you promise to return the favor." Man agreed, and Crocodile bore him safely across the water
		When they reached the far bank, Man asked, "How can I repay you?" Crocodile replied, "I wish to see the realm of Humans, but I fear to go there alone, because it teems with your brethren. You must carry me on your back across your realm." Man had been tricked, but a promise is a promise, so he carried Crocodile safely on his back across the entire realm of humans, a journey that lasted many years. He also swore, in his anger, that never again would Men and Crocodiles be friends, and so it has remained to this day.
