## 5th Level Ranger
![[Sylvos.png]]
Swamkeeper Ranger (Bees)
A member of the harpers. Cousin of [[Yosei]]

When he started ranging for the Silver Knights, there was an incursion of bandits. He tried to get the jump on the four of them and lost, but right as he neared death spiritual bees appeared and saved him. A favorite memory of his was [[Yosei]]'s father bee keeping.

Fun fact: he doesn't like blueberry turnovers.

## Goal
- Find [[Artus Cimber]] on behalf of [[The Harpers]].
