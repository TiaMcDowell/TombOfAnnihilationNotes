![[Professor-Hancock.png]]
## 3rd Level Storm Sorcerer
An older man, Professor Hancock claims to be both an archeologist and a pirate. He hasn't said where he's from, and his pirate outfit is clearly fake, but what his goals are remain unknown. What is known is that he hates those with telepathy who intrude on the sanctity of his mind.
