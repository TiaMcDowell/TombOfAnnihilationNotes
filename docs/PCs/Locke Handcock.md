# Professor Locke Hancock
## 3rd Level Storm Sorcerer
An older man, Professor Hancock claims to be both an archeologist and a pirate. He hasn't said where he's from, and his pirate outfit is clearly fake, but what his goals are remain unknown. Locke hates psychics who intrude on his mind.

He played track and field in junior high, so he's pretty confident in his long jump abilities. Sadly his dexterity is awful.

He says he's lived 74 years "on this plane". Despite his old age, he knows next to nothing about the sword coast and its gods. He also occasionally forgets key details (like owning a spyglass).
