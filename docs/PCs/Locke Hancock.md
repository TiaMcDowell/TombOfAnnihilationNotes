*"Professor Locke Hancock"*
## 4th Level Storm Sorcerer & 1st Level Fighter
An older man, Professor Hancock claims to be both an archeologist and a pirate. He's told [[Yosei]] that he's from Sharn in Eberron, but wound up in space after delving too deep on an archeology expedition.

After drifting with some asteroids, he was picked up by a Giff pirate crew where he met the love of his life Betsy (his big hippo GF).

After about two decades, he was kidnapped by some Mind Flayers and experimented on. During a jump to the elemental plane of air, he escaped. Somehow he landed in Fearun with a new body as a Blue Dragonborn Storm Sorcerer.

His dexterity and memory were severely damaged, but now he can cast spells and perform magics. He played track and field in junior high, so he's pretty confident in his long jump abilities.

He says he's lived 74 years "on this plane". Despite his old age, he knows next to nothing about the Sword Coast and its gods. He also occasionally forgets key details (like owning a spyglass).
