The Flaming Fist of Baldur's Gate has laid a claim to all territory and resources East of the Mistcliff Mountains. They permit explorers, but only if they've purchased a Charter of Expedition and clearly stated what their objectives are, and promise to give a slice of the profits to the Flaming Fist.

Failure to produce a valid charter when asked by a Flamig Fist patrol is punishable by whatever means the commanding officer deems fit, up to and including death.
