The Death Curse is an odd affliction, seemingly local to Chult. Folks who have been raised from the dead in the past are beginning to waste away as their flesh appears to rot off their bones. Additionally, ressurecting people has become quite unreliable. Priests are finding it more and more difficult to grasp the souls of the departed with spells like  Revivify and  Raise Dead. Many in Port Nyanzaru are worried the curse/disease will soon spread to the rest of Faerûn, or that raising people may stop working entirely.

[[Nanny Pu'pu]] thinks her old coven made the death curse. Her coven was the sown sisters: widow grout, baggy nanna, and a third who repalced nanny Pu'pu.
