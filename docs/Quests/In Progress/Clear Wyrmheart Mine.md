>Deep within an old dwarven hole lies a young dragon "as red as Asmodeus' asshole". It's hoard contains precious adamantium.

A drunken dwarf rambled on to Professor Hancock over drinks in [[Port Nyanzaru]]. His brother was far quieter, but perhaps once they sober up we'll be in for the heist of a century.

In the Thundering Lizard, [[Hew Hackinstone]] and [[Musharib]] were having a rather... "vocal" discussion about the state of the family mine and adamantine forge.

The pair would like you to slay the dragon and reclaim their mine and forge.

Dragon names Tindalor(Tider for short)
