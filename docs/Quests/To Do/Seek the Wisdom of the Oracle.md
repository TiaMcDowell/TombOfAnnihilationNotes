# Seek the Wisdom of the Oracle
There are rumours of an oracle named Saja N'baza who is allegedly omniscient. She can see the past, present and future without fail. Those who seek her wisdom and pass her trials can ask her three questions, no holds barred.

She lives in an old ziggurat named Orolunga, somewhere on the interior side of the Mistcliff Mountains.
