The cook of the Thundering Lizard,  [[Azaka Stormfang]], once lived in a clan who made their home alongside River Tiryki. Their ancesteral home was raided by Pterafolk (Terrorfolk), scattering the clan. Azaka found safety in [[Port Nyanzaru]], but many of her clan did not.

The pterafolk have made a nest in one of their spiritual monuments: a 300ft tall tower named Firefinger. To make matters worse, they've taken a prized heirloom as a trophy: the Mask of the Beast.
