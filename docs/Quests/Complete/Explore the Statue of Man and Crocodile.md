# Explore the Statue of Man and Crocodile
#complete
A recent jungle expedition recovered a Tattered Wizard's Journal from a band of goblins they defeated. It appears to describe a wizard's adventure in plundering ruins inside a statue shaped like a man and crocodile. The wizard got their ass kicked, but maybe you'll fare better.

 [[Prince Wakanga O'Tamu]] has also informed you he caught wind of the Flaming Fist sending an expedition there somewhat recently.

(The journal also describes a clockwork golem. See:  [[Recover the Clockwork Golem]])
