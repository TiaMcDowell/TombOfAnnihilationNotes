A recent jungle expedition recovered a Tattered Wizard's Journal from a band of goblins they defeated. It appears to describe a clockwork golem, possibly originally belonging to [[The Lost City of Mezero]]. [[Prince Wakanga O'Tamu]] would like you to verify it exists, and if possible, figure out a way to bring it back to [[Port Nyanzaru]] to add to his collection.

(The journal also describes a statue shaped like a man and crocodile, which may contain a valuable relic. See:  [[Explore the Statue of Man and Crocodile]])

Sadly, it seems [[Rodvan]] and [[Ellias]] currently have control over the golem. Perhaps the party can convince them to trade for it?
