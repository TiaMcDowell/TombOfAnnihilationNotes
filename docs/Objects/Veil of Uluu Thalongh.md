> This black veil appears to be made of condensed smoke, and feels nearly ephemeral to the touch. While worn, you are hidden from divination magic: you cannot be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. 
> As an action, you can use the veil to cover your face and cast the spell  True Seeing (self only). Once the veil has been used in this way, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
