Part of [[Recover the Clockwork Golem]]
Found in [[Session 06]] by [[Camp Righteous]]

The golem had a spinny chair, CTR screens, dials, and levers. [[Locke Hancock]] was unable to kickstart it with shocking grasp, and [[Xandala Cimber]] fixed some dents with menting. It seems as though the party is missing some sort of key to activate it.

Using a crystal amulet stolen from some goblins, [[Rodvan]] and his apprentice were able to activate and use it. Takes about 1 spell slot for every four hours.
