To become Abara, you take a trial in the [[Temple of Ubtao]]. If you pass, Ubtao offers you the position of Abara. Alisandra and [[Artus Cimber]] both took the trial, but Artus rejected it and took the [[Ring of Winter]] instead.

Abara only die in combat or in great cataclysms. Then a new bara is selected by someone taking the trials in the [[Temple of Ubtao]] in [[The Lost City of Mezero]].
