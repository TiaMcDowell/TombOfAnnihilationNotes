*See [[Seek the Wisdom of the Oracle]]*

Outside the entrance, there are human like hands with an inscription.
> Power in the hand is knowledge in the head

Based on [[Locke Hancock]]'s estimate, the monument is at least 3000 years old, but the gates and braziers are only a few hundred years old.

Igniting the braziers causes the doors to attempt to open, but the vines keep it closed. [[Brysh]] in the [[Clockwork Golem]] helps slash the vines and gets the gate open.

Atop the pyramid, there's a large hole leading to a 5ft pool about 40ft below.

After the traps and trials, the party meets Saja N'baza, the oracle.
