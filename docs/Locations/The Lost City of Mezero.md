Mezro was once an isolated and secretive city state on the East coast of Chult. It was protected by a Mythel. Unfortunately, the city was utterly destroyed during the Second Sundering and its ruins are now a popular destination for treasure hunters.

It seems several members of the party are quietly interested in searching for the ruinsâ€¦

It was destroyed during the second sundering.

About 40 years ago the Cult of the Frost invaded and [[Artus Cimber]] helped defend the ancient city.

[[Alisandra Cimber]] and [[Ras Nsi]] are [[Abara]] of Mezro.
