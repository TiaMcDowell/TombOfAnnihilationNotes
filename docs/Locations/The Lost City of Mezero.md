# The Lost City of Mezro
Mezro was once an isolated and secretive city state on the East coast of Chult. Unfortunately, the city was utterly destroyed during the Second Sundering and its ruins are now a popular destination for treasure hunters.

It seems several members of the party are quietly interested in searching for the ruins...

It was destroyed during the second sundering.
