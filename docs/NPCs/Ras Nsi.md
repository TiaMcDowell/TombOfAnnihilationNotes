The exiled [[Abara]] patron of [[Morgan]] with an undead army.

He has lost control of the undead, and suspects this is due to [[The Death Curse]].

He died with [[The Lost City of Mezero]], but was resurrecred by some Yuan-ti. He has a palace near [[Omu]].

[[Xandala Cimber]] is scared of Ras Nsi, and was told very bad things about him. Her parents were only alligned for the invasion from the [[Cult of the Frost]].

Ras Nsi is one of the original [[Abara]] and was exiled 2000-3000 years ago. Before Mezro there was a group of people called the Eshowe. They clashed with the people of Mezro, so Ras Nsi sent his undead army to wipe them out compleately. The Abara didn't condone this, so they exiled him. With no longer needing to fend off the Eshowe, the city of Mezro could develope and advance their technology much quicker. He still serves Mezro, but he's fanatical in his devotion to Mezro. Ras Nsi cannot enter the city, but fought the [[Cult of the Frost]] from afar.
