A member of [[The Red Wizards of Thay]] and a seller of magic items to [[Prince Wakanga O'Tamu]]. He was sent away on an expedition to [[The Lost City of Mezero]] by his superiors, and his whereabouts are unknown.

We met him at the party in [[The Thundering Lizard]]. He's very eager and a 11th-12th level conjurer.
