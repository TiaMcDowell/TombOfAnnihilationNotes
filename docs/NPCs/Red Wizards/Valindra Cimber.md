[[Xandala Cimber]]'s sister, was a soldier in a war. Does not want anything to do with [[Xandala Cimber]], and they haven't seen each other in six years.

She likes frogs, and turned out to be Shadowmantle!

After her father left, she took care of the house on her own. Eventually got drafted into the Cormyrian war wizard army fighting Netheril. After the war, she joined the [[The Red Wizards of Thay]].

She rose through the ranks of [[The Red Wizards of Thay]] quicker than just about anyone else. She's only been part of them for about three and a half years, but she's nearly at the top of their ranks.

High ranking leaders of Thay are Zulkir (litches), and it's possible she wants to become one too. There's only eight, one per school, but she wants to be the ninth. It's also a seat of political power and imortality. If she gets another big win, the leader will promote her. Weaponizing the death curse might be her plan for the promotion.
