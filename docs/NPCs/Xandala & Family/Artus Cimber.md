Letter to [[Xandala Cimber]]
> Xandala, Valindra
I'm so sorry. I know I can repeat that a thousand times and it will never be enough. I have failed at everything I've sought to do with my life. I've failed to resist the thrall of the ring, I've failed to protect your mother, and I've failed to be there for both of you when you needed me most. I am a terrible, wretched man and a worse father.
I can never expect forgiveness, but before I breath my last, know I will do everything I can to undo the wrongs I've done. I may not be able to do anything to help Icewind Dale, and the few kind folks who know who I am tell me to let the Ten Towns heal on their own. I cannot control that, but there is one last thing to be done which I can control. I swear on the last of my honour that I will bring Alisanda back to you two alive. I was given a vision: Mezro is out there. The myths are true and the city _wasn't_ destroyed. Just for a few brief seconds, I could even see your mother's face: as beautiful as the day she departed Cormyr.
I will die a broken man, but if I can give you two a shred of the happiness you deserve, that's enough for me. Hold tight in Suzail, and keep your hope. I'm chartering a vessel to Port Nyanzaru. I'm going to make this right.
Be better than me. I love you both so much.
-Artus

## The Ring of Winter
A ring of power that he found in [[The Lost City of Mezero]]. It was protected in the inner sanctum of [[Ubtao]] (before it was destroyed in the second sundering.

[[Xandala Cimber]] says it's something to keep quiet and it could get her in trouble. It could herald in a new ice age.

The ring has a powerful thrawl and a will of its own. He started to lose control after his wife [[Alisandra Cimber]] "died."

He used it to make snowcones.
