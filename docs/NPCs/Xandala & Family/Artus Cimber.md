[[Xandala Cimber]]'s Father, an archeologist that is missing. Is protected from divination due to a magic ring (possible the same [[ring of winter]] he possesses). He uses other various magic items to cast spells. His ring of winter prevents aging. He looks to be about 30-40.

A member of the harpers!

Taught [[Yosei]] the frostfinger's spell.

He has a dagger nicknamed *Bookmark*!

## Letter to Xandala and Valindra

> Xandala, Valindra
> 
> I'm so sorry. I know I can repeat that a thousand times and it will never be enough. I have failed at everything I've sought to do with my life. I've failed to resist the thrall of the ring, I've failed to protect your mother, and I've failed to be there for both of you when you needed me most. I am a terrible, wretched man and a worse father.
> 
> I can never expect forgiveness, but before I breath my last, know I will do everything I can to undo the wrongs I've done. I may not be able to do anything to help Icewind Dale, and the few kind folks who know who I am tell me to let the Ten Towns heal on their own. I cannot control that, but there is one last thing to be done which I can control. I swear on the last of my honour that I will bring Alisanda back to you two alive. I was given a vision: Mezro is out there. The myths are true and the cityÂ _wasn't_Â destroyed. Just for a few brief seconds, I could even see your mother's face: as beautiful as the day she departed Cormyr.
> 
> I will die a broken man, but if I can give you two a shred of the happiness you deserve, that's enough for me. Hold tight in Suzail, and keep your hope. I'm chartering a vessel to Port Nyanzaru. I'm going to make this right.
> 
> Be better than me. I love you both so much.
> 
> - Artus
