Was from Chult([[The Lost City of Mezero]])
Probably dead mother of [[Xandala Cimber]] and [[Valindra Cimber]], wife of [[Artus Cimber]].

Weirdly, despite the pointy ears [[Alisandra Cimber]] and her daughts are not half elves. It's suspected this is due to her magical connection to Mezero changing her bodily form.

Because she's abara, she's imortal.
