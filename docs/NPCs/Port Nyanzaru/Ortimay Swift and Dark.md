She was our ship captain who sailed us to Chult. She used us to smuggle narcotics for [[Poc Marked Po]], but had her ship searched as we left.

She narrowly dodged an Allosaurus and escaped the executioner's run in [[Port Nyanzaru]]. [[Locke Hancock]] used a fog cloud to give her an edge, and she acknowledged it. Hopefully she'll be able to repay the favor in the future.

We see a Stegosaurus Baker and a dinosaur race. Next session we'll race!
