# Aremag
A giant dragon turtle who roams the entrance to [[Port Nyanzaru]]. If he surfaces and ships don't pay him his fee in gold, he capsises them.

Sadly the boat containing [[Yosei]], [[Sylvos]], [[Artus Cimber]], and [[Ash]] was destroyed by Aremag.

When [[Locke Hancock]] and [[Brysh]] arrived, [[Ortimay Swift and Dark]] paid the turtle's fee and they were left unscaved.
